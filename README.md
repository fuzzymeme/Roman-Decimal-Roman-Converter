# Roman-Decimal-Roman-Converter
Converts back and forth between Roman and Decimal characters. 

The aim of the project for me was to practice Python on a simple self-contained project. Initially inspired by a interview question to convert Decimal numbers to the equivalent using Roman numerals. After I decided to write code to perform the reverse. In theory you could then write a calculator program that uses Roman numerals. 

Pretty happy with the results. The DecimalToRomanConverter does convert 4's to iiii (as opposed to iv) which some may take exception to. However from my reading of the subject this is valid notation, it's also the notation used on watch faces that use Roman Numerals. Perhaps I'll revisit the code some day as tweak it to produce either style.
